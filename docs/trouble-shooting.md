# Troubleshoot a Manatee Shard in Distress.
This guide will list the most common failure scenarios of Manatee and steps to
resuscitate the Shard.

## Warning
You should read the user guide first to ensure you understand how Manatee works.
Some of the recovery steps could potentially be destructive and result in data
loss if performed incorrectly.

# Manatee-adm

The primary way an operator should be interacting with manatee is via the
`manatee-adm` CLI.  The main tool for assessing the cluster's overall state is
`manatee-adm pg-status`.

# Healthy Manatee

The output of `# manatee-adm pg-status` of a healthy manatee shard will look like
this:

    ROLE     PEER     PG   REPL  SENT       WRITE      FLUSH      REPLAY     LAG   
    primary  bb348824 ok   sync  0/671FEDF8 0/671FEDF8 0/671FEDF8 0/671FE9F0 -     
    sync     a376df2b ok   async 0/671FEDF8 0/671FEDF8 0/671FEDF8 0/671FE9F0 -     
    async    09957297 ok   -     -          -          -          -          0m00s 

There are 3 peers in this shard, a `primary`, `sync`, and `async`.  The "PG"
column indicates that Postgres is online.

If anything is wrong with the cluster, errors or warnings will be printed below
this output.  Errors indicate problems that likely affect service, while
warnings indicate problems that should not directly be impacting service at the
moment.

The REPL column (and subsequent columns) describes the replication state of each
peer to its immediate downstream peer. For example, the primary's REPL column
represents the state of replication to the synchronous peer.  A primary peer
with "-" in the REPL column means replication is offline between the primary and
the sync. A sync peer with "-" in the REPL field means that replication is
offline between the sync and the async.

A 3-node manatee shard is healthy only if there are 3 peers in the shard, all
three peers are marked "ok" in the "PG" column, the primary's REPL is "sync",
and the sync's REPL is "async".  As mentioned above, the tool checks these
conditions and prints out when something is wrong.

# Troubleshooting under-the-hood

"manatee-adm pg-status" should automatically identify problems with the cluster.
In previous versions of Manatee, operators were required to use the "manatee-adm
status" command and verify these conditions manually.  The rest of this guide
describes the process of identifying problems based on the "manatee-adm status"
output, but it should no longer be required on newer versions of Manatee.

# Symptoms

Here are some commonly seen outputs of `manatee-adm status` when the shard is
unhealthy. Before you start: click [here](http://calmingmanatee.com/).

## manatee-adm status Shows Only a Primary peer.
```json
{
    "sdc": {
        "primary": {
            "id": "10.99.99.16:5432:12345",
            "ip": "10.99.99.16",
            "pgUrl": "tcp://postgres@10.99.99.16:5432/postgres",
            "zoneId": "ebe96dfb-2533-459b-964b-a5ad7fb3b566",
            "backupUrl": "http://10.99.99.16:12345",
            "online": true,
            "repl": {}
        }
    }
}
```
This assumes you have an HA manatee shard setup. Some installations of SDC such
as COAL by default only come with 1 manatee peer. In those cases, this is the
expected output of `# manatee-adm status`.

1. [Check that no manatee peers are out of disk
space](#manatee-runs-out-of-space).
1. [Find the set of manatee peers in the
DC](#find-the-set-of-manatee-peers-in-a-dc). If this returns only 1 peer, then
you do not have an HA manatee setup.
1. Log on to a non primary peer.
1. Restart the manatee-sitter process. `# svcadm disable manatee-sitter; svcadm enable manatee-sitter`
1. Check via `# manatee-adm status` that you see 2 peers with replication information.
If this peer is unable replicate e.g. the sitter service goes back into
maintenance, postgres dumps core, or you still don't see replication state,
Then you'll need to rebuild this peer via `# manatee-adm rebuild`
1. Continue to [here](#manatee-adm-status-shows-no-async-peer-only-primary-and-sync-are-visible)

1. [Check that no manatee peers are out of disk
space](#manatee-runs-out-of-space).
1. [Find the set of manatee peers in the DC](#find-the-set-of-manatee-peers-in-a-dc) and verify that an async peer exists.
You should see 3 instances -- the missing async is the instance that is missing from `# manatee-adm status`
1. Log on to the async peer.
1. Restart the manatee-sitter process. `# svcadm disable manatee-sitter; svcadm enable manatee-sitter`
1. Check via `# manatee-adm status` that you see 3 peers with replication information.
If this peer is unable replicate e.g. the sitter service goes back into
maintenance, postgres dumps core, or you still don't see replication state,
Then you'll need to rebuild this peer via `# manatee-adm rebuild`

## manatee-adm status Shows No peers.
```json
{
    "sdc": {}
}
```

1. [Check that no manatee peers are out of disk
space](#manatee-runs-out-of-space).
1. [Find the set of manatee peers in the DC](#find-the-set-of-manatee-peers-in-a-dc).
If this returns nothing, then no manatee peers are deployed.
1. Log on to any manatee peer.
1. Check the manatee state:
```

1. Log on to the mantaee primary.
1. Make sure that the `manatee-sitter` process is running.  If not, start it.
1. Check `# manatee-adm status` and ensure that the primary is online.
1. Log on to the mantaee sync and make sure it is running.
1. Log on to asyncs and make sure they are running.
1. You can check the set of manatee peers that are connected to zk with the
   `# manatee-adm zk-active` command:
```

## Manatee Runs out of Space
Another really common scenario we've seen in the past is where the manatee zones
runs out of space.

The symptoms are usually:

* You can't login to the zone at all.
>```
>[Connected to zone 'e3ab01c5-d5d0-423c-97de-2c71183302d9' pts/2]
>No utmpx entry. You must exec "login" from the lowest level "shell".
>
>[Connection to zone 'e3ab01c5-d5d0-423c-97de-2c71183302d9' pts/2 closed]
>```

* Manatee logs show errors with `ENOSPC`
>```
>[2014-05-16T14:51:32.957Z] TRACE: manatee-sitter/ZKPlus/10377 on 5878969f-de0f-4538-b883-bdf416888136 (/opt/smartdc/manatee/node_modules/manatee/node_modules/zkplus/lib/client.js:361): mkdirp: completed

You can check that the zone is indeed out of memory by checking the space left
on the zone's ZFS dataset in the GZ. Here we assume the manatee zone's uuid is
`e3ab01c5-d5d0-423c-97de-2c71183302d9`

Notice that the zone's delegated dataset has no more space.

### Solution

1. Increase the zone's ZFS dataset. In the GZ, run:
>```
># zfs set quota=100G zones/e3ab01c5-d5d0-423c-97de-2c71183302d9
>```
>Verify there's free space in the dataset.

1. Update the manatee service's quota in SAPI. Once you've made the local
changes to the ZFS quota, you'll want to update the manatee service in SAPI
such that future manatee zones will be deployed with the quota you've set. You
can do this on the HN via sapiadm. In this example the quota size is set to
500G.
>```
># sapiadm update $(sdc-sapi /services?name=manatee | json -Ha uuid) \
>    params.quota=500
>```

# Useful Manatee Commands
## Find the set of manatee peers in an SDC deployment
This lists the manatee peers in each DC by `zone_uuid, alias, CN_uuid, zone_ip`.
From the headnode, run:
```
[root@headnode (staging-1) ~]# sdc-sapi /instances?service_uuid=$(sdc-sapi /services?name=manatee | json -Ha uuid) | json -Ha uuid  | xargs -n1 sdc-vmadm get  | json -ga uuid alias server_uuid nics.0.ip

```
## Find the set of manatee peers in a Manta deployment
This lists the manatee peers in each DC in Manta.  If you have a multi-dc
deployment, this will not find x-dc peers.  From the headnode, run:
```
[root@headnode (staging-1) ~]# manta-adm show postgres
SERVICE        SH ZONENAME                             GZ ADMIN IP
